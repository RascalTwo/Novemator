> A new top-of-the-line security keypad has been developed to keep out anyone without sufficient mathematical skills, with daily reshuffling they're impenetrable!

> You find nine of these, will you be able to enter any today?

A game in which the user must use a keypad with it's numbers and operators shuffled daily to generate a secret number.

## How it works

First generates the operators and numbers randomly - but seeded to be the same for an entire day.

Then generates all possible expressions and values for the difficulty the user choose.

A chosen difficulty represents how many keys needs to be pressed to end up with the result.
